# i2p-os
Like Whonix, except for I2P


## How to use

To run an i2p-os virtual machine that runs on a virtiofs shared folder (with no virtual disk and no virtual bootloading process):
- Download a prebuilt image at [https://cdn.theartofmonero.com/i2p-os.tar.gz](https://cdn.theartofmonero.com/i2p-os.tar.gz) (Github does not allow over 2GB file uploads) or build your own with the [manual build instructions](./manual-build.md)
- Create a virtual machine by following the [Virtual machine setup](./manual-build.md#virtual-machine-setup-virtiofs-image) section of the manual build instructions
